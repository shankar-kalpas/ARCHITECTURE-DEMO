# System Architecture Overview

In this document, we'll provide an overview of the recommended system architecture for your applications, considering scalability, security, and performance considerations.

## Application Components

### Frontend
- The frontend of your application is built using Next.js.
- It is hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for scalability and easy deployment.

### Backend
- The backend is implemented using Node.js.
- It runs on Amazon EC2 instances for better control over a large codebase.

### Admin Dashboard
- The admin dashboard is hosted alongside the frontend, either within the same Elastic Beanstalk environment or as a separate service, depending on your security requirements.

### WordPress
- You have a WordPress instance running on an Amazon EC2 instance.
- Regular backups and security updates are essential for maintaining WordPress.

### Containers
- Docker containers are used for hosting self-hosted email and SMS service providers.

```

1. **Regular Backups**
   - Utilize AWS RDS automated backups for the MySQL database.
   - Schedule snapshots for the EC2 instance hosting WordPress.
   - Implement container backup strategies for Docker containers.

2. **Redundancy**
   - Deploy resources across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.

## Scaling to 2000 Users Concurrently (Simplified)

1. **Auto-Scaling**
   - Configure auto-scaling for the AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment based on traffic patterns.
   - Manually scale EC2 instances for the backend as needed.

2. **Load Balancing**
   - Implement AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute traffic for the frontend and admin dashboard.

## Testing Process (Simplified)

- Define a comprehensive testing process that covers unit testing, integration testing, load testing, and security testing.
- Utilize tools and services like Jest, Mocha, Postman, and JMeter based on your specific needs and codebase size.
