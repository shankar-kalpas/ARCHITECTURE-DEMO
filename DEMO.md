# System Architecture Overview

In this document, we'll provide an overview of the recommended system architecture for your applications, considering scalability, security, and performance considerations.

# AWS Service Pricing (Estimates)

Here are rough estimates for AWS services used in the architecture:

## Application Components

### Frontend
- The frontend is hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, There is no additional charge for AWS Elastic Beanstalk. You only pay for what you use, as you use it.
  - Pricing details: [Elastic Beanstalk Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/pricing/)

### Backend
- The backend runs on Amazon EC2 instances, with the cost depending on the instance type and usage Avg: $16. 
  - Pricing details: [EC2 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/)

### Admin Dashboard
- The admin dashboard is hosted on Elastic Beanstalk, with similar costs to the frontend.

### WordPress
- Your WordPress instance on EC2 might cost around $12 per month, but it varies based on instance type and usage.
  - Pricing details: [EC2 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/)

### Containers
- Docker container costs are associated with the EC2 instances they run on.

```

1. **Regular Backups**
   - Utilize AWS RDS automated backups for the MySQL database.
   - Schedule snapshots for the EC2 instance hosting WordPress.
   - Implement container backup strategies for Docker containers.

2. **Redundancy**
   - Deploy resources across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.

## Scaling to 2000 Users Concurrently (Simplified)

1. **Auto-Scaling**
   - Configure auto-scaling for the AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment based on traffic patterns.
   - Manually scale EC2 instances for the backend as needed.

2. **Load Balancing**
   - Implement AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute traffic for the frontend and admin dashboard.

## Testing Process (Simplified)

- Define a comprehensive testing process that covers unit testing, integration testing, load testing, and security testing.
- Utilize tools and services like Jest, Mocha, Postman, and JMeter based on your specific needs and codebase size.
